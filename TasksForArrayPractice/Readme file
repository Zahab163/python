# NumPy 3D Array Operations

This project demonstrates basic operations using a 3D NumPy array. It showcases how to access, manipulate, and extract data from multi-dimensional arrays using Python's NumPy library.

## ðŸ“¦ Setup

```bash
pip install numpy
 Array Structure
We create a 3D NumPy array shaped (2, 3, 2) using np.arange() and reshape(). This gives:
- 2 blocks (depth)
- 3 rows per block
- 2 columns per row
 Core Operations
 Accessing Elements
- Access a specific element

 Looping Through Blocks

 Maximum Values
- Maximum of each individual block

Slicing Rows
- Print last row of every block

 Data Manipulation
- Replace all even numbers with 0

 Count values greater than 10

 Outcome
This exercise strengthens your understanding of:
- 3D array indexing and slicing
- Conditional replacement
- Aggregation functions (sum, max, count)
- Boolean masking
